# End-to-End CAPTCHA Solver

This project implements an end-to-end system to solve synthetic alphanumeric CAPTCHAs using classical and deep learning-based approaches.

## Overview

The goal is to predict the character sequence from a distorted CAPTCHA image, handling variations such as:
- Rotation
- Color distortions
- Font style changes
- Background noise

Have fun experimenting with different models and techniques!
